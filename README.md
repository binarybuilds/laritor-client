[Laritor](https://laritor.com) is a full-stack observability platform built for Laravel.

It gives you everything you need to understand what’s happening inside your application. From slow requests and 
database queries to failed jobs, exceptions, and server resource usage.

### ❤️ Why Developers Love Laritor

- **Find performance bottlenecks in seconds:** See exactly which queries, cache calls, or external requests are slowing your app.
- **Debug errors with full context:**. Every exception is captured with a complete request timeline, logs, database queries, and related events.
- **Monitor servers like a pro:** Track CPU, memory, and disk usage alongside your Laravel metrics — no extra server monitoring tool needed.
- **Stay ahead of production issues:** Get instant alerts for slow requests, failed jobs, unhealthy servers, or custom health checks.
- **Reduce time-to-fix dramatically:** No more guessing — pinpoint the problem and deploy a fix faster.
